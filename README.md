# Breast_cancer_EDA_ML
Exploring and predicting breast cancer diagnosis with ML models

This is my second data science project.
Techniques used in the project include:
 - linear regression line fitting, scoring and plotting
 - statistical analysis and mapping
 - using SMOTE to oversample minority data
 - ML models: DecisionTree, RandomForest, SVM
 - model validation using cross-validation methods

Again this has been an small but engaging project with ML models predicting binary outcome.

My next project is to work on a multi-outcome data set while learning Pytorch. Then the following project I'd like to 
try a project using deep learning!
